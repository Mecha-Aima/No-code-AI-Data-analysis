# Rain Prediction with Akkio
==========================

This use case explores the application of Akkio, a no-code AI tool, to predict rain events based on environmental data.

## Dataset
----------

The dataset used for this project is a small publicly available CSV file from Kaggle, containing only a few hundred rows of data. The dataset includes features such as:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind speed
* ...and others

The target variable is a binary value indicating whether it rained or not.

## Methodology
--------------

Using Akkio's visual interface, I:

1. Loaded the CSV dataset into Akkio
2. Configured the model settings for classification
3. Trained the model on the dataset
4. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score
5. Generated predictions for the rain events

## First Attempt
--------------

The initial attempt at training the model resulted in severe overfitting, with the model performing poorly on unseen data. This is evident in the `first_attempt` folder, which contains the original model's predictions and performance metrics.

## Revised Approach
-----------------

To address the overfitting issue, I revised the approach by:

1. Using a smaller and faster model architecture
2. Reducing the number of training epochs
3. Increasing the regularization strength

The revised approach yielded significantly better results, with improved accuracy and F1 score. The revised model's predictions and performance metrics can be found in the `revised` folder.

## Dataset and Cleaning
----------------------

The original dataset and cleaned version can be found in the `data` folder. The cleaning process involved handling missing values and scaling the features.

## Conclusion
----------

This use case highlights the importance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning in achieving good performance. The revised approach demonstrates that even with a small dataset, a well-configured model can yield reasonable results.

## Report and Results
--------------------

The reports generated by Akkio, including the model's performance metrics and predictions, can be found in the `first_attempt` and `revised` folders.
