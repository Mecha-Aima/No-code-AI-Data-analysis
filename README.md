# No-Code AI Experiments with Akkio
=====================================

This repository contains a collection of use cases exploring the capabilities of Akkio, a no-code AI tool for data analysis, cleaning, and prediction. The goal of this project is to experiment with Akkio's performance on various tasks and compare its results to custom-coded models.

## Use Cases
------------

The following use cases are included in this repository:

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Located in the `Fraud detection` folder, this use case utilizes Akkio to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset.
2. **Supermarket Sales Forecasting**: Found in the `Supermarket sales prediction` folder, this use case employs Akkio to predict sales for a supermarket based on historical data.
3. **Rain Prediction**: Located in the `Rain prediction` folder, this use case uses Akkio to forecast rain events based on environmental data.

## Methodology
--------------

For each use case, I used Akkio's visual interface to:

* Load and clean the dataset
* Configure the model settings
* Train and evaluate the model
* Generate predictions and reports

Unfortunately, Akkio does not allow exporting the underlying code, so I have included screenshots and report links for each project to provide insight into the results.

## Results and Observations
---------------------------

While Akkio's performance was not outstanding, I noticed that its performance degraded with increasing amounts of data. This suggests that Akkio may not be well-suited for large-scale datasets or complex problems.

## Future Work
--------------

I plan to continue adding more use cases to this repository to further experiment with Akkio and other no-code AI tools. By comparing their performance to custom-coded models, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations.

## Data and Reports
-------------------

The data, results, and report links for each use case are included in the respective folders. Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
