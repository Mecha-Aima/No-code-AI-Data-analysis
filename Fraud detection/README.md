# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Akkio
=====================================

This use case explores the application of Akkio, a no-code AI tool, to detect credit card fraud based on transaction data.

## Dataset
----------

The dataset used for this project contains approximately 555,000 rows of credit card transaction data. The dataset includes the following features:

* Transaction date and time
* Merchant name
* Merchant biodata
* Merchant category
* Merchant latitude and longitude
* Job
* ...and others

The target variable is the **is_fraud** column, which is a binary value indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

## Methodology
--------------

Using Akkio's visual interface, I:

1. Loaded the CSV dataset into Akkio
2. Configured the model settings for binary classification
3. Trained the model on the dataset
4. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1 score
5. Generated predictions for the is_fraud values

## Results
----------

Unfortunately, the model's performance was not impressive, with low accuracy and F1 score. This is likely due to the complexity of the problem and the sheer volume of data.

## Challenges
------------

1. **Large dataset**: With approximately 555,000 rows of data, the model's performance may have been impacted by the sheer volume of data.
2. **Model tuning**: Further tuning of the model's hyperparameters and running it for a longer period may improve the model's performance.

## Ignoring Columns
-------------------

Akkio provides an option to ignore certain columns that may not add value to the prediction. This feature can be useful in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and improving model performance.

## Future Work
--------------

To improve the model's performance, I plan to:

1. Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal settings
2. Experiment with different model architectures and algorithms
3. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's generalization performance

## Report and Results
--------------------

The report generated by Akkio, including the model's performance metrics and predictions, can be found in the report_link file in this directory.

Note: Due to the limitations of Akkio, the underlying code is not available. However, the dataset and report can be used to reproduce the results and explore further improvements.
